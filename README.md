## Deployed Application

This challenge does not include a deployed application. Instead, a screen-recorded video is submitted alongside the github repo link.

## Future Improvements

 * Separate js files into a better file structure. I tried to separate them at first, but the functions I needed across files were not functioning properly. It was happier all together in one file in the end.
 * Remove the (index) column from the tables when they print to the console.
 * Add the bonus features like more updates, deleting data, and sorting the column views
